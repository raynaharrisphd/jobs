## Sierra Nevada University, June 6, 2020

I am writing to express my interest in an Adjunct Faculty position. I have a BS in
Biochemistry and a PhD in Cell and Molecular Biology from the University of Texas at
Austin. I currently live in Truckee and am working remotely for the University of
California, Davis as a postdoctoral scholar. My current research investigates the neural
and molecular mechanisms that regular parental care behavior in pigeons, and I am
developing software that integrates art and music to communicate scientific findings.

I have 13 years of experience teaching hands-on courses at the college level, including
organic chemistry, molecular biology, bioinformatics, and data science. Given the current
crisis, many educators are teaching online. I also have three years of experience teaching
highly-interactive online courses. Since 2015, I have been teaching The Carpentries
Instructor Training program online via Zoom. I have written blog posts about strategies
that teachers can use to engage with their learners online and compared the pros and
cons of teaching online versus in person. I hope that schools can reopen soon, but I am
prepared to teach online and accommodate students who can only participate remotely.

This winter, I worked part-time in the Childrenâ€™s Ski and Snowboard School at Northstar,
and I enjoyed connecting with members of the Truckee community through our shared
passion for teaching and respect for the outdoors. I would like to continue working part-
time to support education in the Lake Tahoe area, and I believe that an Adjunct Faculty
position at the Sierra Nevada University could be an excellent fit.

I look forward to learning more about the position and the Biology department.
