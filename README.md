## Center for Scientific Collaboration and Community Engagement, July 24, 2020

I am writing to express my interest in the Lead Trainer and Curriculum Development Specialist
position. I often described myself as a scientist, educator, community-builder, and translator,
and I believe that my past experiences and current interest in the interdisciplinary fields of life
science, community engagement, and curriculum development are closely aligned with the
responsibilities of this role.

I have a B.S. in Biochemistry and a Ph.D. in Cellular and Molecular Biology from The University
of Texas. During my post-bachelor years, I taught hands-on laboratory classes in organic

## RStudio, July 25, 2020

I want to express my interest in the Solutions Engineer position. I enjoy using R to find answers
to biological questions, and I find joy in helping others use R to solve global problems.

I remember seeing `ggplot` for the first time during a 3 hour Introduction to R workshop at The
University of Texas at Austin in 2011. R was only being taught in a few classes, but a
burgeoning community of data scientists and bioinformaticians were filling gaps in the
curriculum by offering hands-on workshops. Through these workshops and my involvement with
The Carpentries, I learned how to use and teach tools such as high-performance computing

## 10X Genomics, Oct 3, 2020

Dear 10X Genomics,

I am writing to express my interest in the Scientist, Applied Bioinformatics position, which I heard about from an employee, Dr. Lisa Johnson. 
I am a multi-disciplinary scientist with seven years of experience supporting bioinformatics researchers through training and community-building. 
I am excited by the possibility of working with a team that supports both the users and developers of products that will advance our understanding of complex biological processes. 

When I started my Ph.D. program in Cell and Molecular Biology in 2012, genomic sequencing was on the rise, but training in bioinformatics was lagging. 
To fill this gap, I worked with the Center for Computational Biology and Bioinformatics to organize a series of regular workshops and a “Big Data in Biology Summer School” to provide regular opportunities for students, postdocs, and staff to receive the computational training they needed.

## CZI, Nov 18, 2020

To the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative,

I am writing to express my interest in the Science Program Officer, Computational Biology position. 
Briefly, I have a Ph.D. in Cell and Molecular Biology. 
My interdisciplinary graduate and post-doctoral research integrate molecular and bioinformatic approaches to address long-standing questions in neuroscience. 
I use R and Juypter extensively for conducting and sharing statistical analyses of large biological datasets. 
A recent fellowship in Community Engagement gave me a foundation of best practices in project management, people management, and scholarly communication for cultivating healthy scientific communities.

## CZI, Mar 1, 2021

To the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative,

I am interested in the Project Manager career opportunity with the Open Science and Science in Society programs at CZI. 

I have a PhD in Cell and Molecular Biology and a decade of experience managing open science projects. I enjoy making discoveries and teaching science, but I believe my greatest contributions to science and society are my ability to empower others to make and share discoveries that advance our understanding of biological processes. 

As an undergraduate, I pursued a degree in Biochemistry because I was fascinated by the beauty of chemical processes and the complex biological systems they regulated. Organic chemistry scared many of my peers, but I enjoyed drawing chemical structures and solving chemical equations. After graduation, I worked as a full-time Teaching Specialist in the Organic Chemistry Department where I gained experience teaching hands-on laboratory experiments. I also dreamed of discovering new chemical compounds in the rainforest and coral reefs. After graduation, I pursued an unpaid post-baccalaureate internship in Costa Rica where I used both my SCUBA diving skills and molecular laboratory training to contribute to a multi-disciplinary research effort to discover biomedical relevant fungi in the ocean.
