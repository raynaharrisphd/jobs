University of Texas at Austin in 2011. R was only being taught in a few classes, but a
burgeoning community of data scientists and bioinformaticians were filling gaps in the
curriculum by offering hands-on workshops. Through these workshops and my involvement with
The Carpentries, I learned how to use and teach tools such as high-performance computing
