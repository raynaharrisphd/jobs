## Sierra Nevada University, June 6, 2020

I am writing to express my interest in an Adjunct Faculty position. I have a BS in
Biochemistry and a PhD in Cell and Molecular Biology from the University of Texas at
Austin. I currently live in Truckee and am working remotely for the University of
California, Davis as a postdoctoral scholar. My current research investigates the neural
and molecular mechanisms that regular parental care behavior in pigeons, and I am
developing software that integrates art and music to communicate scientific findings.

I have 13 years of experience teaching hands-on courses at the college level, including

## Center for Scientific Collaboration and Community Engagement, July 24, 2020

I am writing to express my interest in the Lead Trainer and Curriculum Development Specialist
position. I often described myself as a scientist, educator, community-builder, and translator,
and I believe that my past experiences and current interest in the interdisciplinary fields of life
science, community engagement, and curriculum development are closely aligned with the
responsibilities of this role.

I have a B.S. in Biochemistry and a Ph.D. in Cellular and Molecular Biology from The University
of Texas. During my post-bachelor years, I taught hands-on laboratory classes in organic

## RStudio, July 25, 2020

I want to express my interest in the Solutions Engineer position. I enjoy using R to find answers
to biological questions, and I find joy in helping others use R to solve global problems.

I remember seeing `ggplot` for the first time during a 3 hour Introduction to R workshop at The
University of Texas at Austin in 2011. R was only being taught in a few classes, but a
burgeoning community of data scientists and bioinformaticians were filling gaps in the
curriculum by offering hands-on workshops. Through these workshops and my involvement with
The Carpentries, I learned how to use and teach tools such as high-performance computing

## 10X Genomics, Oct 3, 2020

Dear 10X Genomics,

I am writing to express my interest in the Scientist, Applied Bioinformatics position, which I heard about from an employee, Dr. Lisa Johnson. I am a multi-disciplinary scientist with seven years of experience supporting bioinformatics researchers through training and community-building. I am excited by the possibility of working with a team that supports both the users and developers of products that will advance our understanding of complex biological processes. 

When I started my Ph.D. program in Cell and Molecular Biology in 2012, genomic sequencing was on the rise, but training in bioinformatics was lagging. To fill this gap, I worked with the Center for Computational Biology and Bioinformatics to organize a series of regular workshops and a “Big Data in Biology Summer School” to provide regular opportunities for students, postdocs, and staff to receive the computational training they needed. I also organized three annual symposia to bring together scientists, engineers, and medical doctors who were using similar tools to solve diverse problems. I set up Google Scholar alerts for members of that community, and I still enjoy reading papers from the collaborations and research projects that were sparked by these cross-disciplinary events.  

After completing my Ph.D., I joined Dr. Titus Brown lab. Instead of conducting research (as is typical in a postdoc position) I focused on communication and community management for The Data Commons Pilot Phase Consortium (DCPPC). The DCPPC consisted of about 500 scientist and engineers from a dozen institutions whose common goals was to build cloud-based infrastructure that would make biomedical data more findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR). In this role, I honed both soft skills and technical skills. I co-organized in-person meetings in different cities, facilitated webinars, conducted online retrospectives, and learned a lot about the intricacies of project and program management. I also beta-tested bioinformatic workflows, built websites, and contributed to the development of new software. This job was incredibly rewarding, and we were all hopeful the project would continue past the pilot phase, but our funding was cut short.

## CZI, Nov 18, 2020

To the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative,

I am writing to express my interest in the Science Program Officer, Computational Biology position. Briefly, I have a Ph.D. in Cell and Molecular Biology. My interdisciplinary graduate and post-doctoral research integrate molecular and bioinformatic approaches to address long-standing questions in neuroscience. I use R and Juypter extensively for conducting and sharing statistical analyses of large biological datasets. A recent fellowship in Community Engagement gave me a foundation of best practices in project management, people management, and scholarly communication for cultivating healthy scientific communities.  

When I started my Ph.D. program in 2012, genomic sequencing was on the rise, but training in bioinformatics was lagging. To fill this gap, I worked with the Center for Computational Biology and Bioinformatics to organize a series of workshops for students and staff to receive the computational training they needed. I also organized three annual symposia to bring together scientists, engineers, and medical doctors who were using similar tools to solve diverse problems. By building relationships across academic disciplines and into industry, government, medicine, we were able to foster new collaborations and promote the transfer of knowledge.

After completing my Ph.D., I joined Dr. Titus Brown's lab as a technical liaison for the Data Commons Pilot Phase Consortium (DCPPC), focusing on communication and community engagement. The DCPPC consisted of about 500 scientist, engineers, developers, and funders from over a dozen institutions whose common goals was to build cloud-based infrastructure that would make biomedical data more findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR). I co-authored onboarding documentation, co-organized in-person meetings, facilitated webinars, conducted online retrospectives, and beta-tested software. Even though the funding for this project was cut short, the long-term benefits of our community-building efforts are evidenced by a continued stream of collaborative projects and co-authored publications.
