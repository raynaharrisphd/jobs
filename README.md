## 10X Genomics, Oct 3, 2020

Dear 10X Genomics,

I am writing to express my interest in the Scientist, Applied Bioinformatics position, which I heard about from an employee, Dr. Lisa Johnson. 
I am a multi-disciplinary scientist with seven years of experience supporting bioinformatics researchers through training and community-building. 
I am excited by the possibility of working with a team that supports both the users and developers of products that will advance our understanding of complex biological processes. 

When I started my Ph.D. program in Cell and Molecular Biology in 2012, genomic sequencing was on the rise, but training in bioinformatics was lagging. 
To fill this gap, I worked with the Center for Computational Biology and Bioinformatics to organize a series of regular workshops and a “Big Data in Biology Summer School” to provide regular opportunities for students, postdocs, and staff to receive the computational training they needed.

## CZI, Mar 1, 2021

To the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative,

I am interested in the Project Manager career opportunity with the Open Science and Science in Society programs at CZI. 

I have a PhD in Cell and Molecular Biology and a decade of experience managing open science projects. I enjoy making discoveries and teaching science, but I believe my greatest contributions to science and society are my ability to empower others to make and share discoveries that advance our understanding of biological processes. 

As an undergraduate, I pursued a degree in Biochemistry because I was fascinated by the beauty of chemical processes and the complex biological systems they regulated. I enjoyed drawing chemical structures and solving chemical equations. After graduation, I worked as a full-time Teaching Specialist in the Organic Chemistry Department where I gained experience teaching hands-on laboratory experiments. I dreamed of discovering new chemical compounds in the rainforest and coral reefs. After graduation, I pursued a post-baccalaureate internship in Costa Rica where I used both my SCUBA diving skills and molecular laboratory training to contribute to a multi-disciplinary research effort to discover biomedical relevant fungi in the ocean.

# Read the Docs, Mar 1, 2021

## 1-2 paragraphs about why you're excited to work on Read the Docs

I have been following the progress of Chan Zuckerberg Initiative since 2015, and I've been aware of Read the Docs hosting services since I started remotely following C. Titus Brown's training program at UC Davis since around the same time. I have a Ph.D. in Cell and Molecular Biology and a decade of experience managing open science projects. I enjoy making discoveries and teaching science, but I believe my greatest contributions to science and society are my ability to empower others to make and share discoveries that advance our understanding of technical, biological, and social processes. I believe a position as a developer advocate with documentation skills will help apply my diverse skill set to help Read the Doc users solve some of the world’s toughest challenges.   

## 1-2 paragraphs about a project you're proud of

In 2015, Greg Wilson, co-founder of Software Carpentry, asked if I could teach UNIX in Spanish to a group of bioinformaticians in Mexico. I was intrigued, but I declined because I didn't think I was fluent enough in either bioinformatics or Spanish. Nevertheless, the idea was planted and by 2018 I was teaching Git in Spanish to a group of computer scientists in Argentina.

# Seven Bridges May 29, 2022

I am writing to express my interest in the Community Engagement Manager position. I was referred by my advisor, Dr. C. Titus Brown. 

I learned about Seven Bridges in 2018 when I served as a postdoc focused on community engagement for the NIH-funded Data Commons Pilot Phase Program. I co-organized six in-person meetings to bring together scientists and engineers to build cloud computing tools for biomedical genomic research. I also performed code reviews for tools that were in development, but funding for the pilot program was cut before we could build a training program. 

Fast-forward to 2022, I am finally helping build and implement a training program in my current role as a postdoc for the Common Fund Data Ecosystem. Our goal is to teach scientists and clinicians how to find, access, and analyze large genomic datasets. I have developed and taught UNIX and R workshops to teach the basics of command-line scripting and data analysis. I have also taught lessons developed by my coworkers, such as Introduction to Amazon Web Services, and I’ve helped colleagues publish tutorials on our training website at https://training.nih-cfde.org/en/latest/. I also perform tests on our data search portal (https://app.nih-cfde.org/), including making sure that files can be imported into CAVATICA using DRS IDs.

When I was younger, “Community Engagement Manager” wasn’t a job that I dreamed of having because I had never heard of it. I dreamed of being a teacher or scientist because I knew what those things were. Indeed, I have 15 years of experience teaching at the college level, and 10 years of experience conducting genome-scale research. However, during my PhD, I was given the opportunity to organize several community-focused events, and this led to community engagement focuses post-doc positions. As I look toward the future, I know that my past experiences and current interests are well suited to a career as a manager focused on community engagement.

# Tahoe Institute for Natural Science July 5, 2022

I am writing to express my interest in the Part-Time Membership Coordinator position I saw advertised on your website. 

Since moving to the Tahoe area in 2019, I have held part-time positions at Rock & Rose Landscaping & Nursery, Palisades Tahoe, and the River Ranch Lodge & Restaurant. These jobs have helped me connect with the community and learn about the local flora and fauna. However, I am looking for a part-time job that better capitalizes on my expertise and training.

I have been involved with community engagement and management since I started graduate school in 2012. I organized a yearly symposium and a week-long workshop series on the topic of Big Data in Biology at The University of Texas in Austin. My role involved coordinating speakers and caterers, reserving rooms, and conducting assessments. I wrote grants to fund events and scientific research. I joined Twitter during this time to live-tweet events and disseminate fliers and blog posts to a large audience.

In 2018, I started a remote post-doctoral position at the University of California, Davis focused on communication, training, and outreach. I organize meetings and events to facilitate collaboration between scientists, engineers, and clinicians to build infrastructure for data-driven biomedical research. I have the technical skills to analyze data and create statistical reports. I also serve on the help desk team that responds to daily requests for help with software or membership. Additionally, I am fluent in Spanish and have worked with volunteers around the world to translate training materials to support non-English speakers in science.
