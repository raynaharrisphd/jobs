## Center for Scientific Collaboration and Community Engagement, July 24, 2020

I am writing to express my interest in the Lead Trainer and Curriculum Development Specialist
position. I often described myself as a scientist, educator, community-builder, and translator,
and I believe that my past experiences and current interest in the interdisciplinary fields of life
science, community engagement, and curriculum development are closely aligned with the
responsibilities of this role.

I have a B.S. in Biochemistry and a Ph.D. in Cellular and Molecular Biology from The University

## RStudio, July 25, 2020

I want to express my interest in the Solutions Engineer position. I enjoy using R to find answers
to biological questions, and I find joy in helping others use R to solve global problems.

I remember seeing `ggplot` for the first time during a 3 hour Introduction to R workshop at The
University of Texas at Austin in 2011. R was only being taught in a few classes, but a
burgeoning community of data scientists and bioinformaticians were filling gaps in the
curriculum by offering hands-on workshops. Through these workshops and my involvement with
The Carpentries, I learned how to use and teach tools such as high-performance computing

## 10X Genomics, Oct 3, 2020

Dear 10X Genomics,

I am writing to express my interest in the Scientist, Applied Bioinformatics position, which I heard about from an employee, Dr. Lisa Johnson. 
I am a multi-disciplinary scientist with seven years of experience supporting bioinformatics researchers through training and community-building. 
I am excited by the possibility of working with a team that supports both the users and developers of products that will advance our understanding of complex biological processes. 

When I started my Ph.D. program in Cell and Molecular Biology in 2012, genomic sequencing was on the rise, but training in bioinformatics was lagging. 
To fill this gap, I worked with the Center for Computational Biology and Bioinformatics to organize a series of regular workshops and a “Big Data in Biology Summer School” to provide regular opportunities for students, postdocs, and staff to receive the computational training they needed.

## CZI, Nov 18, 2020

To the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative,

I am writing to express my interest in the Science Program Officer, Computational Biology position. 
Briefly, I have a Ph.D. in Cell and Molecular Biology. 
My interdisciplinary graduate and post-doctoral research integrate molecular and bioinformatic approaches to address long-standing questions in neuroscience. 
I use R and Juypter extensively for conducting and sharing statistical analyses of large biological datasets. 
A recent fellowship in Community Engagement gave me a foundation of best practices in project management, people management, and scholarly communication for cultivating healthy scientific communities.

## CZI, Mar 1, 2021

To the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative,

I am interested in the Project Manager career opportunity with the Open Science and Science in Society programs at CZI. 
I have a PhD in Cell and Molecular Biology and a decade of experience managing open science projects. I enjoy making discoveries and teaching science, but I believe my greatest contributions to science and society are my ability to empower others to make and share discoveries that advance our understanding of biological processes. 
As an undergraduate, I pursued a degree in Biochemistry because I was fascinated by the beauty of chemical processes and the complex biological systems they regulated. I enjoyed drawing chemical structures and solving chemical equations. After graduation, I worked as a full-time Teaching Specialist in the Organic Chemistry Department where I gained experience teaching hands-on laboratory experiments. I dreamed of discovering new chemical compounds in the rainforest and coral reefs. After graduation, I pursued a post-baccalaureate internship in Costa Rica where I used both my SCUBA diving skills and molecular laboratory training to contribute to a multi-disciplinary research effort to discover biomedical relevant fungi in the ocean. 
From 2008 to 2017 I worked as a lab technician and then a graduate student in Hans Hofmann’s lab at The University of Texas. As a technical, I combined laboratory and teaching expertise to work on several collaborative projects and train other scientists. During this time, I presented our research at numerous conferences around the world, developed and taught numerous workshops, co-authored 20 scientific publications, and wrote numerous blog posts. My research broadly focused on understanding the neural and molecular processes that regulate animal behavior. I embraced open-science during this time and used R for reproducible data analysis. All of my thesis research is available on GitHub, and my thesis chapters can be easily read online at https://www.raynamharris.com/Thesis/.  
During graduate school, I also served as the Training and Outreach Coordinator for the Center for Computational Biology and Bioinformatics. Genomic sequencing was on the rise, but training in bioinformatics was lagging. To fill this gap, I organized a series of workshops and four annual symposia to bring together scientists, engineers, and medical doctors who were using similar tools to solve diverse problems. By building relationships across academic disciplines and into industry, government, medicine, I was able to foster new collaborations and promote the transfer of knowledge. I started conducting post-workshop assessments and writing blog posts to communicate my interpretation, but I needed guidance on best practices. A colleague introduced me to the non-profit organization Software Carpentry (which later merged with Data Carpentry for form The Carpentries) and I became an avid volunteer. I instructed workshops, mentored and trained new instructors, served on the Board of Directors, and collaboratively developed new lessons. Through these experiences, I became skilled at managing online communities and serving as a liaison between sub-communities.
After completing my Ph.D., I joined Dr. Titus Brown's lab as a technical liaison for the Data Commons Pilot Phase Consortium (DCPPC), focusing on communication and community engagement. The DCPPC consisted of about 500 scientists, engineers, developers, and funders from over a dozen institutions whose common goal was to build cloud-based infrastructure that would make biomedical data more findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR). I co-authored onboarding documentation, co-organized in-person meetings, facilitated webinars, conducted online retrospectives, and beta-tested software. The long-term benefits of our community-building efforts are evidenced by numerous collaborative projects that have continued years after the initial funding period ended. Dr. Rebecca Calisi-Rodríguez and I were brought together to make science videos about the DCPPC. Then she hired me to work on a science communication project funded by National Geographic and an NIH-funded project investigating the neural and molecular basis of parental care in pigeons. For the latter project, I developed an R Shiny application to allow rapid exploration of a very large, open RNA-seq dataset. This software can be easily and freely accessed online at https://raynamharris.shinyapps.io/musicalgenes/.

# Read the Docs, Mar 1, 2021

## 1-2 paragraphs about why you're excited to work on Read the Docs

I have been following the progress of Chan Zuckerberg Initiative since 2015, and I've been aware of Read the Docs hosting services since I started remotely following C. Titus Brown's training program at UC Davis since around the same time. I have a Ph.D. in Cell and Molecular Biology and a decade of experience managing open science projects. I enjoy making discoveries and teaching science, but I believe my greatest contributions to science and society are my ability to empower others to make and share discoveries that advance our understanding of technical, biological, and social processes. I believe a position as a developer advocate with documentation skills will help apply my diverse skill set to help Read the Doc users solve some of the world’s toughest challenges.   

## 1-2 paragraphs about a project you're proud of

In 2015, Greg Wilson, co-founder of Software Carpentry, asked if I could teach UNIX in Spanish to a group of bioinformaticians in Mexico. I was intrigued, but I declined because I didn't think I was fluent enough in either bioinformatics or Spanish. Nevertheless, the idea was planted and by 2018 I was teaching Git in Spanish to a group of computer scientists in Argentina.
