## UC Berkeley Extension, June 27, 2020

I am writing to express my interest in a teaching position in Sciences, Mathematics and
Biotechnology. I have a BS in Biochemistry and PhD in Cell and Molecular Biology from
the University of Texas at Austin. I currently live in Truckee and am working remotely as
a postdoctoral scholar for the University of California, Davis. My scientific research
investigates the neural and molecular mechanisms that regulate learned and social
behaviors. My postdoctoral responsibilities involve data analysis, software development;
science communication, and peer mentoring.

I have thirteen years of experience teaching hands-on courses at the college level. I was a
teaching assistant in Organic Chemistry Laboratories, Biostatistics, and Problems in
Modern Biology. I have taught many short workshops in molecular biology,
bioinformatics, and data science. I have four years of experience teaching a highly-
interactive online instructor course for The Carpentries. I am fluent in Spanish from my
experiences working in a microbiology laboratory in Costa Rica and teaching data
science in Argentina. Iâ€™ve worked with a global community of educators to develop and
translate lessons, and teach workshops for core computer and data science skills.

Teaching and learning are mentally challenging under normal circumstances and are
extremely difficult during the current health, economic, environmental, and political
crises we are experiences. I hope that schools can reopen soon, but I am prepared to teach
online or in a hybrid setting. It is possible to build remote communities of support for
professors and scholars, and I am happy to help the UC Berkeley Extension community
however I can.

I look forward to learning more about the students and faculty at UC Berkeley Extension
where I hope to apply my expertise and experience as a professor of the sciences and
biotechnology.
