# Tahoe Institute for Natural Science July 5, 2022

I am writing to express my interest in the Part-Time Membership Coordinator position I saw advertised on your website. 

Since moving to the Tahoe area in 2019, I have held part-time positions at Rock & Rose Landscaping & Nursery, Palisades Tahoe, and the River Ranch Lodge & Restaurant. These jobs have helped me connect with the community and learn about the local flora and fauna. However, I am looking for a part-time job that better capitalizes on my expertise and training.

I have been involved with community engagement and management since I started graduate school in 2012. I organized a yearly symposium and a week-long workshop series on the topic of Big Data in Biology at The University of Texas in Austin. My role involved coordinating speakers and caterers, reserving rooms, and conducting assessments. I wrote grants to fund events and scientific research. I joined Twitter during this time to live-tweet events and disseminate fliers and blog posts to a large audience.

In 2018, I started a remote post-doctoral position at the University of California, Davis focused on communication, training, and outreach. I organize meetings and events to facilitate collaboration between scientists, engineers, and clinicians to build infrastructure for data-driven biomedical research. I have the technical skills to analyze data and create statistical reports. I also serve on the help desk team that responds to daily requests for help with software or membership. Additionally, I am fluent in Spanish and have worked with volunteers around the world to translate training materials to support non-English speakers in science. 

I look forward to learning more about the mission and vision of the Tahoe Institute for Natural Science and how I can contribute to your science, education, and outreach efforts to promote natural history, conservation, and ecosystem knowledge in the Tahoe region.

Thank you for your consideration,
Rayna M. Harris, PhD
