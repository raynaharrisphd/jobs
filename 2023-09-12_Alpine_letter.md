## Alpine Meadows, September 12,  2024

I am applying for the Members Locker Rooms Supervisor position at Alpine. I know the mountain well because   
I worked as a Parking Supervisor for the last three winters and enjoy skiing and snowboarding all of Alpine's terrain.     
I have many years of experience in customer service, managing projects, and supervising small groups.
