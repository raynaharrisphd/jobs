# Read the Docs, Mar 1, 2021

## 1-2 paragraphs about why you're excited to work on Read the Docs

I first heard about the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative in 2015, and I have followed the progress of the growth of the organization every since. I've been using 
Read the Docs documentation building and hosting services since I discovered the training program run by C. Titus Brown at UC Davis. I have a Ph.D. in Cell and Molecular Biology and a decade of experience managing open science projects. I enjoy making discoveries and teaching science, but I believe my greatest contributions to science and society are my ability to empower others to make and share discoveries that advance our understanding of biological processes. I believe a position as a developer advocate with documentation skills at Read the Docs will help me contribute to the shared goals of leveraging technology to help solve some of the world’s toughest challenges.   

## 1-2 paragraphs about a project you're proud of

In 2015, Greg Wilson asked if I could teach UNIX to a group of Spanish-speaking bioinformaticians in Mexico. I was interested, but I declined because I didn't think I was fluent enough to teach or answer questions in Spanish. But seeds had been planted, and in 2018 I found myself teaching Git in Spanish in Argentina. 
The project that bridged that gap was a community-driven effect to translate Software Carpentry lessons into Spanish [1]. This way, workshops could be taught in their native language in Latin America and Spain. The English versions of Software Carpentry lessons are written in Markdown and shared on GitHub. We used email and later slack to coordinate a truly global effort to translate lessons for teaching Unix, Git, Python, and R into Spanish. The effort promoted the growth of many local Carpentry communities in Latin America, Europe, and North America by creating resources that could be used and shared to teach bioinformatics to broader audiences. 

## Anything else you'd like us to know?

After my post-doc ended in 2020, I started working as a seasonal Parking Host at the ski resort Alpine Meadows in Olympic Valley, CA. After a short three months, I was promoted to a Supervisor for my ability to learn new tasks, coordinate others, analyze data, and identify team needs. This job has given me new perspectives on the needs of teams and team members and different strategies for project management. I also have part-time work during the North American summer, so contract work 3-5 days a week is during UTC-8 to UTC+1 is okay.
