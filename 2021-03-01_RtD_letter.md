## 1-2 paragraphs about why you're excited to work on Read the Docs

I have been following the progress of Chan Zuckerberg Initiative since 2015, and I've been aware of Read the Docs hosting services since I started remotely following C. Titus Brown's training program at UC Davis since around the same time. I have a Ph.D. in Cell and Molecular Biology and a decade of experience managing open science projects. I enjoy making discoveries and teaching science, but I believe my greatest contributions to science and society are my ability to empower others to make and share discoveries that advance our understanding of technical, biological, and social processes. I believe a position as a developer advocate with documentation skills will help apply my diverse skill set to help Read the Doc users solve some of the world’s toughest challenges.   

## 1-2 paragraphs about a project you're proud of

In 2015, Greg Wilson, co-founder of Software Carpentry, asked if I could teach UNIX in Spanish to a group of bioinformaticians in Mexico. I was intrigued, but I declined because I didn't think I was fluent enough in either bioinformatics or Spanish. Nevertheless, the idea was planted and by 2018 I was teaching Git in Spanish to a group of computer scientists in Argentina. 

The project that bridged that gap in my skills and confidence was a community-driven effect to translate Software Carpentry lessons into Spanish. Software Carpentry is an open-source, community-driven project to teaching computing skills. In 2017, a small group of bilingual instructors coordinated over group email and Slack to coordinate a global effort to translate lessons for teaching Unix, Git, Python, and R into Spanish. The effort promoted the growth of many local Carpentries communities in Latin America, Europe, and North America by creating resources that could be used and shared to teach bioinformatics to broader audiences. Our approach and the impacts are described in more detail in this blog post https://carpentries.org/blog/2019/01/python-ecology-es/ and this bi-lingual poster written in LaTex https://www.overleaf.com/project/5cc20fbf61491f0afa725048.

## Anything else you'd like us to know?

After my post-doc ended in 2020, I started working as a seasonal Parking Host at the ski resort Alpine Meadows in Olympic Valley, CA. After a short three months, I was promoted to a Supervisor for my ability to learn new tasks, coordinate others, analyze data, and identify team needs. This job has given me new perspectives on the needs of teams and team members and different strategies for project management that I can apply as a developer advocate. Additionally, this is a part-time job that I can maintain while balancing part-time work for Read the Docs.  I live in PST and am available to work between UTC - 8 and UTC-8 to UTC+1.
